            <h2>Captions</h2>
            <p>Captions are generally given in the same language as the original content. It includes relevant sound effects or background noises because the intended audience is those who cannot hear the audio for some reasons.</p>

            <h3>Translations for pigeons</h3>
            <p>
                Obviously, none of us can understand what pigeons are saying, so we'll just make up some subtitles! Create your own time stamps and invent your own dialog!
